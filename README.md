# Book Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a **content-based book recommendation system** that suggests books based on similarities in titles and authors using **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity**. It also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) on book ratings and author statistics, providing insights into the dataset before generating recommendations.

### What is **TF-IDF**?
TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical technique that reflects how important a word is to a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in a document but is offset by how frequently the word appears in the entire corpus.

- **TF**: Measures how frequently a term occurs in a document.
- **IDF**: Measures how important a term is by penalizing common terms that appear in many documents.

In this project, TF-IDF helps convert text data (book titles and authors) into numerical vectors.

### What is **Cosine Similarity**?
Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi dimensional space. It is used to calculate the similarity between two book vectors generated by TF-IDF.

- A **cosine similarity of 1** means the two books are very similar.
- A **cosine similarity of 0** means the books are dissimilar.

By comparing vectors of books, we can recommend books that are most similar to the one provided by the user.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is **books_data.csv**, which includes essential information about books such as:
- **Book ID**
- **Title**
- **Author**
- **Average Rating**

This dataset is used to create a recommendation system that helps users discover books similar to their preferences based on book metadata (title and author). The data is assumed to be sourced from a public domain or a curated collection for educational purposes.

## Key Features

ðŸ“Œ **Data Preprocessing**
- Reads and cleans book data using `pandas`
- Converts text columns and ratings into appropriate data types
- Handles missing values and creates a combined text feature for recommendations

ðŸ“Š **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualizes the distribution of average ratings
- Displays the number of books published by the top 10 authors
- Generates a word cloud of book titles to reveal common terms

ðŸ“š **Content-Based Recommendation System**
- Implements **TF-IDF Vectorization** on book titles and authors
- Computes **cosine similarity** between books to find the most similar recommendations
- Returns top 10 book recommendations based on input book title
  
## Conclusion
This project delivers a simple yet effective **book recommendation system** that suggests books based on content similarity. It also offers insights into book ratings and author distributions. This system is ideal for learning purposes and can be expanded further with additional metadata like genres or descriptions.

## Next Steps
- **Enhance Recommendations**: Incorporate book genres, summaries, or user reviews into the recommendation logic.
- **Deploy as Web App**: Create a simple web interface using `Streamlit` or `Flask` for interactive recommendations.
- **Improve Matching**: Implement fuzzy matching to handle typos or partial book titles in user queries.
